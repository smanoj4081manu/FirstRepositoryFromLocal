Hello, This is Manoj
I have created a file in the local and added it to repository.

Edited the file. Adding new lines of information in the existing file.

Again editing the file. After committing the changes in to master from github desktop, i didnt observe this updated in the github web portal. Seems after synch only it updated. checking again.
After waiting for 5 mins, nothing happened. So, pressing Synch in Github Desktop and will check if updated in GitHub web portal.

Not that it is proved that click 'Sync' button, changes committed on GitHub desktop are updated to remote, we will see how Pull Request will work.

When there is only one branch, there is no significance of 'Pull Request' as the 'Create Pull Request' button is disabled and a message stating "The source and destination branches are the same." is displayed. So sync is the only option to update the changes in to server when there is only one branch.
Cheers!! for the research.

Created a new branch named 'ManojBranch'. Checking how it works.
Updating the file from the command prompt using the command vim FirstFile.txt.
After update press Esc to escape edit mode of the file and input :x to submit the changes to the file.
This is the next edit from the command line. Will press again esc and then input the text :x and submit the changes again. Yayy!! i am mastering this. 

Update same file from Manoj-Branch-1 & 2 and verify Pull Request issues. This is from Manoj-Branch-2

Opened in Manoj-Branch-1
